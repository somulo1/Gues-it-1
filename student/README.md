# Guess It - Number Range Predictor

## Overview

The "Guess It" project is a program designed to predict the range of the next number based on a sequence of input numbers. By implementing statistical calculations and probabilities, the program analyzes the given data and provides a predicted range for the subsequent number. This project serves as an exercise in mathematical reasoning and scripting.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to build a program that takes a series of numbers as input and outputs a range for the next number. The program analyzes previous numbers and determines a suitable range based on mathematical calculations.

## Instructions

The program reads numbers as standard input and prints out the predicted range for the next number in the sequence. The expected input format is as follows:

## Running the Program

To make it easier to run the Go program, weâ€™ll use `npm` to manage the build and execution of the Go code. Here's how to set up and run the project:

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Make sure Go is installed on your machine.
- **npm**: Node.js and npm should also be installed to manage scripts.

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/somulo/guess-it-1.git

   cd guess-it-1

2. **run the program**

    i. **install npm**
    ```bash 
    npm install
    ```
    ii. run npm
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
3. **find server in brower**
   ``` bash
     http://localhost:3000 

     ```
    to it please add this ```?guesser=<name_of_guesser><br> ```for example 
    ``` http://localhost:3000/?guesser=big-range```. name of the gueser can also be ```standard deviation``` or ```avarage```.
